### What testing framework did you find? 
  I found the framework called PyTest. This was built for most types of testing but especially Functional and API testing.  
### Did you find any differences between that framework and unittest?
  Some differences that I found between the two is that in unittest, we make a class with functions for each test. Differently, we make individual tests (less repeatability) in pytest.
  There are similar packages for both frameworks:
    - Approx (PyTest) / AssertAlmostEqual (unittest)
    - raises (PyTest) / AssertRaises (unittest)
    - assert (PyTest) / AssertEqual (unittest)
    - plus many more!
  Another difference that I found was that, as mentioned, PyTest is good for Functional and API testing, whereas unittest is more optimal for automated unit testing
